# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles).

These files are used to customize system behavior, applications, games, and development environments across different operating systems.

The goal of this repo is to keep my configurations version-controlled, portable, and easy to set up on new machines.

## What You’ll Find Here

- System configuration files (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Application and tool configs
- Game configuration files
- Performance and quality-of-life tweaks
- Scripts or automation related to setup (optional)

## Structure

The repository is organized by platform or application when possible.

Examples:

dotfiles/
├── linux/
├── windows/
├── macos/
├── Games/
│   ├── Apex Legends/
│   └── CS2/
├── scripts/
└── README.md

Not all folders may exist at all times.

## Usage

These dotfiles are tailored to my personal preferences.  
You are free to use, modify, or adapt them for your own setup.

Always back up existing configuration files before replacing them.

## Notes

- Some configs may depend on specific software versions.
- Operating system or application updates may overwrite configs.
- No guarantees — use at your own risk.
